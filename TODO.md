- [x] DMP vs gloval MP for ZS
- [ ] vx, vy, vz are passive variables in AdvectionSolver?
- [ ] cupy
- [ ] a benchmarks/ folder. ex: benchmarks/error_convergence/
- [ ] working euler example
- [ ] switch from f"v{dim}" style to "v" + dim style for slight performance improvement
- [ ] multi-core support
- [ ] coverage
- [ ] expand README.md
